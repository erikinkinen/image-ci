## description

Manjaro libhybris is designed to run on Android devices.

Currently three different types of images are available, phosh, nemomobile and minimal

The phosh variant is the most complete and usable one which has phosh pre installed with everything to have it usable as a functional phone

The nemomobile variant is heavily under development and its not stable nor very usable, It's more of a proof of concept as of now.

minimal images are just manjaro's base system which can be used a a server or workstation or user can install any of the available graphical user interfaces (one being phosh and one being nemomobile)

lomiri images are not out yet but are planned to be added.

## where can I download an image?

Images are built and uploaded in a relatively regular interval to [github releases](https://github.com/manjaro-libhybris/image-ci/releases)

# how can i install an image?

To install an image just boot to your favorite recovery and flash the image created for your device.
